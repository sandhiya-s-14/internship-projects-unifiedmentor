# 💼 Internship Projects – Furniture Sales & Coca-Cola Stock Forecasting

Hi there! 👋 I'm **Sandhiya**, a Data Science undergrad from **D.G. Vaishnav College**, and this repo holds the two projects I completed during my **Data Analytics internship with Unified Mentor**.

These projects gave me real-world experience working with messy data, building ML models, and turning insights into results. Let me walk you through them!

## 🛋️ Project 1: Predicting Furniture Sales (E-Commerce)

### 🔍 What I Did
I worked with e-commerce product data (similar to what you’d see on AliExpress), and tried to predict how well an item would sell — classifying each product into **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** sales.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

### ✨ Highlights
- Cleaned and transformed price data 💸
- Created custom features like `discount_percent` and `free_shipping`
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier
- Got about **64% accuracy** in predicting sales categories
- Visualized key trends like discount vs. sold units

## 🥤 Project 2: Forecasting Coca-Cola Stock Price

### 🔍 What I Did
This time I switched to financial data — using Coca-Cola’s historical stock prices to predict its future **closing price**. I also added live prediction using `yfinance`.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- `yfinance` API (for live stock data)

### ✨ Highlights
- Calculated 20/50-day moving averages 📉
- Engineered features like daily return & volatility
- Built a Random Forest Regressor
- Measured model performance using MAE and MSE
- Predicted today's price using real-time data from Yahoo Finance 📡
